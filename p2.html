	<h2>
		Description
	</h2>

	<p>
		This is a design I created using p5 to represent a lost item of a luggage lock. The story of this lost lock was described to me by my partner Mariana. Her description of her lost luggage lock was : "It was a green luggage lock. The shape was a simple rectangle (probably about 1in x 2in) and pretty thin as well.colored in a green apple shade. It had 3 silver turning dials on the right edge, each dial could be turned to show a number from 0-9. On the top there was two holes connected by an arch shaped silver tube." The design is interactive with your mouse, give it a try!
	</p>

	<h2>
		Design Process
	</h2>

	<p>
		I started by creating the simple primitive shape of the luggage lock, then used p5 reference to figure out how to create a feature that include push, translate, pop, and translate interactively.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Reflections
	</h2>
	<p>
		The language my partner used to describe the image was very thorough and allowed me to have a clear mental image of the object. I think that, since it is also a simplistic 2D primative, it is probably similar to what her luggage lock looked like. The luggage lock is depicted as described with a background that includes the required elements.
